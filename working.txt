The main circuit diagram of the project has two main portions, one being 
the power bank charging circuitry and the other being DC to DC converter. 
The charging circuitry is being made with TP4056 and the converter is made 
with the XL6009. The converter is for boosting the voltage from 3.7V to 
4.5V or 6V as required by the cell phone. The voltages are variated through 
a potentiometer to get the required level. The micro USB pin is used for 
the charging of the lithium cell (18650) and a female USB connector is 
utilized for the charging of the phone. Sliding Switch is also used for 
the altering the charging mode of the 18650 cell of the phone.
