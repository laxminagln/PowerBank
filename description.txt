There are numerous ways through which you can make the power bank circuit 
e.g. one of the easiest way is to use a boost converter for making the power bank. 
However, one of other easy way to make the power bank circuit is by using different 
modules which can be used for the charging of the cell phone.

The components required are:
PCB board
IC TP4056
XL 6009
Inductors (33uH)
Female connector (USB)
Charging pin (Female/Mini USB)
Burg stick
Capacitors (1uF, 10uF, 220uF, 100uF, and 47uF)
Variable resistor of 5K ohms.
Lithium Cell 18650
LEDs
Diodes 1N5824
Resistors (1K ohm, and 1,2 K ohms)
