Before implementing the design of printed circuit board of the power bank, it is 
highly recommended that schematics of the circuit must be run successfully. This 
is because when you are having error free running simulations of the circuitry, you 
can make the connections easily in its PCB design and have an error free connections.
 
You are required to place the traces for the circuit and meanwhile you will place the 
components that you require in the circuit. For example, either you place all the 
components for the design, and then connect each component or first place the traces 
and then place vias for the components. All it depends on your own need and ease.
